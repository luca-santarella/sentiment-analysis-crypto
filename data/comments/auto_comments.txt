It looks like this post is about taxes.  Tax laws vary between countries, so you may get more helpful replies if you specify the place you are asking about.  Please note that Rule #4 does not allow for Tax Evasion.  This is [a site wide rule](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [a subreddit rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules/).  Do not endorse, suggest, advocate, instruct others, or ask for help with tax evasion.  Do not be coy and sarcastically recommend against it or suggest using a privacy coin in response to an IRS inquiry.  Note:  Tax discussion is allowed as long as the above rules are not violated.  ***  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It looks like you've posted a [Google AMP link](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847).  Please try posting again with the direct link to the article (You shouldn't see "amp" anywhere in the URL) or contact the moderators if you need help.  AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad). It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.  It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.  For individuals seeking an automated solution to this problem, they can try installing the Redirect AMP to HTML extension on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-amp-to-html/kifkmmpiicbcnkjaliilaoeaojlldonl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/?src=search).
