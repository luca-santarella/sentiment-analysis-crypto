What are you basing this on? You expose yourself as not really knowing anything about how people actually invest. The model isn't different.  Most investors will never short anything in their life.  Most financial advisors don't short stocks for their clients (both advisors and firms don't like the extra risk).  Hedge fund managers and sophisticated investors will short stocks but to say the average retail investor is shorting stocks is just completely incorrect.,0.0

At the time it was a normally priced pizza and it was probably consumed right away. The buyer used BTC in leau of fiat and therefore could have easily bought the 10000 BTC back for the same equivalent price as he paid for the pizza with the fiat he did not spend when he paid in BTC. Therefore it was not the most expensive pizza in history.

You guys don‚Äôt know what your talking about... I work in anti money laundering... just transfer all your crypto to a ledger. This will buy you time to make a rational decision to cash out any crypto.  The problem is proving where the source of funds are generated from (regular job? Drug financing? Etc). KYC is basic things any financial institution needs to know but I myself prefer to not tell anyone how much crypto I hold.,0.0

If you're looking for a coin which *does move independently of BTC then HEX is the only one which I am aware of that currently does this. When BTC and the rest of the market crashed back in april/may HEX continued making new ATHs despite that.,1.0
